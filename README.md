## Open Source Software (OSS) Progress Report

A place to keep track of all my open source contributions and the progress reports.

## How To Use
If you are looking to start your OSS journey, feel free to use the template provided to record your progress. This can be done by clicking on the "Use this template" button. 
> Template repositories let users generate new repositories with the same directory structure and files.
You do not need to include all branches from this repository (i.e leave the "Include all branches" option untouched).

P.S For NUS SOC peers:

This repository started for the purpose of tracking my work done for [CP3108A NUS OSS](https://nus-oss.github.io/). You can see my progress report in the "tlylt" branch [here](https://github.com/tlylt/oss-progress-report/blob/tlylt/nus-oss/markbind.md) if you would like to find out more information about my experience. I also encourage you to use
this template (share with me if you do) and go contribute to open source projects.

Good luck!

## Use Case
- Weekly progress log and thoughts
- Elaboration of selected contributions and implementations
- Link to related resources
- As a guide/introductory material for new developers to get a sense of a contributor journey
- As evidence/summary of contributions done, possibly as part of a/an:
  - school module requirement
  - software engineering program
  - internship
  - fellowship
  - official open source work
  - etc

## Pros
- Write with Markdown
- Online editing with Github GUI
- Easy to sharing with others
- Reference to Github repos/issues/PRs directly
- Options to convert Markdown files into more visually appealing formats in the future

## Cons
- When involving sensitive information
- Initial/potential reliance on usage of Github
- Familiarity with Markdown syntax

## Development

### Nov 27 2021
I have completed my inital module work for NUS OSS and the report is viewable
[here](https://github.com/tlylt/oss-progress-report/blob/tlylt/nus-oss/markbind.md) for those who are interested to have a glance of the workload.

In addition, this repository is now available as a [template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).
### Aug 8 2021
I will be testing it out and tweaking this to suit my needs. My usage of the template will be in a separate branch `tlylt` and can be seen [here](https://github.com/tlylt/oss-progress-report/blob/tlylt/nus-oss/markbind.md).

If it is somehow relevant and useful to others, I will make further updates to:
- potentially make this into a repo template for easier adaptation
- include a proper how-to-use guide for anyone who share the use cases above and want to use this as a starting point to their OSS Progress Report
